## What is the project?

This project is a calculator working on an ESP32 and a TFT Touchscreen.
It is going to be solved using an ![ESP32](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-feather/overview)
programmed in baremetal C with the ![ESP-IDF Library](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.1/esp32/api-reference/index.html)
and a ![touchscreen](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-3-5-color-320x480-tft-touchscreen-breakout) attached to the controller via SPI.
It will allow users to:

- Input numbers and calculate the results of those numbers based on the arithmetic operation they choose.
- Input functions and get an interactive graphic of those functions.
- Open a menu to select graphics mode or calculator mode.

## When will the project be finished?

The tasks board can be seen in the ![associted project](https://github.com/users/joelsnz/projects/3).
The project will be complete once all the MVP features have been implemented.
